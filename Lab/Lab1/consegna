The purpose of task is to explore the data quality and understand their distribution, measure characteristics.
Sometimes this task is known as exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Steps to be done and result provided:
(1) determine data type (categorical, binary, numerical, ...), characterize them by displaying graphically (histogram, pie, time series, ...). Choose at least 2 numerical and at least 2 categorical features to explore - data quality report: table and graphs
(2) explore the quality of data: find outliers and make decision about them, find missing values if any, determine the cardinality - data quality report (append it): table and graphs
(3) explore the shape of distribution. Perform standardization and normalization, consider the normality of data  - graphs and description of actions done
(4) explore the characteristics of features: central tendency, spread measures and dependency (the technique depends on which data type you have) - table of characteristics
(5) append the data set with two derived features of different types (at least 2 out of 4) - description of new features (types, characterics, distribution)
